## 📖 Project Overview

The **Diabetic Prediction using Deep Learning Model.ipynb** notebook demonstrates:

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Building a simple yet powerful **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**
- Training and evaluating the model
- Predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on clinical features

The goal is to create a robust model to assist healthcare providers in early diagnosis.
